## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Minor**: Need to test on different lighting conditions
2. **Minor**: Head movement degrades accuracy (re-calibration helps)
3. **Enhancement**: Could add blink detection for alternative click
4. **Enhancement**: Virtual keyboard for typing

---

## üé® Next Enhancements (Future Versions)

### v1.1 - Stability
- Improved accuracy with more training epochs
- Better head pose compensation
- Mobile optimization

### v2.0 - Features
- Blink detection for clicking
- Virtual keyboard
- Voice feedback
- Multiple user profiles
- Settings panel (dwell time, cursor size, etc.)

---

## üìù Notes

### What Worked Well
- MediaPipe FaceMesh is incredibly accurate
- TensorFlow.js makes ML accessible in browser
- 1‚Ç¨ Filter provides great smoothing
- React hooks make state management clean
- Incremental development approach

### Lessons Learned
- Always validate eye features (blinks cause bad data)
- Smoothing is critical for usable eye tracking
- Dwell-click is more reliable than blink detection
- localStorage works great for persistence
- Good lighting is essential

### Technical Decisions
- **Why 9 points?** Balance between accuracy and calibration time
- **Why 1‚Ç¨ Filter?** Best balance of smoothness and responsiveness
- **Why 1.5s dwell?** Long enough to avoid accidental clicks, short enough to be usable
- **Why TensorFlow.js?** Browser-native ML, no backend needed
